# Newton-fractal-visualization
This repository contains the implementation of a program that computes Newton fractals, a fascinating visualization of polynomial roots in the complex plane using Newton's method. The program can handle complex arithmetic defined manually, compute roots for various initial conditions, and visualize fractals in high resolution.
